python packages used:
tensorflow

numpy
keras
opencv
This project implements a face mask detection system using OpenCV and a pre-trained deep learning model. The system detects faces in real-time through a webcam feed and classifies whether each detected face is wearing a mask or not.

Usage
Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.
The application will display the webcam feed with face mask detection overlays.
Faces detected without masks will be highlighted in red, while faces with masks will be highlighted in green.
